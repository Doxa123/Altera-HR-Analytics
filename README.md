This significant gender gap highlights a potential area for diversity and inclusion initiatives.<br>
2. Full-Time vs. Part-Time Employment: A majority of Altera's employees work full-time (15,040 employees, 64.03%), while a notable proportion work part-time (8,450 employees, 35.97%). This distribution could indicate flexibility in work arrangements, catering to employees with varying needs and preferences.<br>
3. Age Distribution: The average age of employees at Altera is 35, with the majority aged between 25 to 40 years. This suggests a relatively young workforce, which can be advantageous in terms of energy and adaptability but might require continuous training and development to retain and nurture talent.<br>

7. Length of Service: The average length of service for employees at Altera is 6 years, with most employees having served between 0 and 10 years, peaking around 3-5 years.
